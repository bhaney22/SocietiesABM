Longform of societies output is here! 

The database structure for Societies output is two
files: long_output.csv and UniqueKey.csv. The UniqueKey 
is a system timestamp in nanoseconds that is passed to 
Societies using the new -d parameter. This key is for one
"batch" or configuration that has one or more runs
associated with it.

Societies prints all variables on one row per day and run
to long_output.csv.

It also prints the uniqueID to the UniqueKey.csv along
with all of the parameters in the config file and from the
command line. 

To start a fresh output file:

1. Copy the current long_output.csv file to where you want to save it.
2. Copy the long_output_header.csv file to long_output.csv to start a
new output file. This saves having to uncomment the print first row
with the variable labels in utils.cpp, re-compiling and re-running, then
commenting it back again and re-compiling. Of course, when the format
of the output file changes there will have to be recompiling.

The same holds true for the UniqueKey.csv file and header.

Supplemental information:
The runlog.csv contains all unique IDs, number of runs and when they 
run, and elapsed time. 

This can be useful to select which batches to select from the 
long_output file once it is in tableau or stata. 

This file is appended to from within the run1.pbs script.
