README

Longform of societies output is here! 

1. The database structure for Societies output is two
files: long_output.csv and UniqueKey.csv. The UniqueKey 
is a system timestamp in nanoseconds that is passed to 
Societies using the new -d parameter. This key is for one
"batch" or configuration that has one or more runs
associated with it.

2. Societies prints all variables on one row per day and run
to long_output.csv.

3. It also prints the uniqueID to the UniqueKey.csv along
with all of the parameters in the config file and from the
command line. 

4. The shellscript _Results.sh will concatenate all of the output files
from the _Results subdirectories into one long file for each file in _Results/
subdirectory named after the config name.

Supplemental information:
The runlog.csv contains all unique IDs, number of runs and when they 
run, and elapsed time. This can be useful to select which batches to select from the 
long_output file once it is in tableau or stata. 
This file is appended to from within the run1.pbs script.
