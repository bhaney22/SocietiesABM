To run batches of the same simulation, set up the runtest.sh shell script. It will call 
the q.sh script, which calls the run1.pbs script. 

After all of the runs are complete, run the _Results.sh shell script that is in the source
code directory to gather all of the long_output.csv files from the subdirectories into
one long file in the _Results top directory.

This file can be merged with the UniqueKey.csv file (and optionally the runlog.csv file) by
UniqueKey to join the run results with the parameters of the runs.
