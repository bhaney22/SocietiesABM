Societies Agent-based Model is an economic harvesting and trade simulation similar to Sugarscape. 
However, agents in Societies can also invent and trade labor-saving devices. 
This repository contains the source code. 
The directory, Configs, contains default configuration files that store input parameters used in defining the simulation context. 
The directory, PBS_scripts, contains scripts for running on a supercomputer cluster.

To recompile the program after making changes, type "make societies" at the command prompt.
