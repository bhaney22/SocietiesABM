Societies Agent-based Model is an economic harvesting and 
trade simulation similar to Sugarscape. However, agents in Societies 
can also invent and trade labor-saving devices. 

This repository contains the source code. 

The sub-directory, Configs, 
		contains configuration files that 
		store input parameters used in defining the simulation context. 
The sub-directory, SLURM_scripts, 
		contains scripts for running on a supercomputer cluster.

To recompile the program after making changes, 
		type "make societies" at the command prompt.


Using SLURM to run on supercomputer:
1.	To run societies using configuration CCC.conf for RR number of runs, 
			execute>> sbatch slurm_societies.sh CCC RR
		
2. To run a parameter sweep of the same simulation.
	a) set up the appropriate parm sweep configs in the Config directory (eg. IOTEST)
	b) set up the loops as needed in run_sweep.script 
	c) 		execute>>  ./run_sweep.script
	d) after all of the runs are complete, execute:
	e) 		execute>> _Results.script 
	
	_Results.script is a shell script that is in the source
		code directory to gather all of the long_output.csv files 
		from the subdirectories into
		one long file in the _Results top directory. 
		
		NOTE: This file can be merged with the UniqueKey.csv file 
		(and optionally the runlog.csv file) by UniqueKey 
		to join the run results with the parameters of the runs.
